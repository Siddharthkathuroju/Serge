VQGAN Compression & Image Captioning App

This project is a full-stack AI-powered application built using Next.js (frontend) and Django (backend). It combines state-of-the-art deep learning models for image compression and image-to-text captioning, making it a powerful demo of computer vision + NLP integration.

‚ú® Features
üîπ 1. Image Compression with VQ-VAE + GAN

Implements Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with GAN-based adversarial training.

Achieves high-quality compression while preserving visual details.

Trained and optimized with regularization + hyperparameter tuning.

Users can upload an image ‚Üí compressed representation ‚Üí reconstructed output.

üîπ 2. Image Captioning with BLIP

Uses a BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)-style model for image-to-text generation.

Upload an image ‚Üí AI generates a meaningful caption/description.

Supports vision encoder + transformer-based decoder.

üîπ 3. Fullstack Web App

Frontend: Next.js (React + Tailwind CSS)

Backend: Django REST Framework (API for ML inference)


Extensible to plug in more ML models.

üìÇ Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS

Backend: Django, Django REST Framework

ML/DL Frameworks: PyTorch, Transformers
